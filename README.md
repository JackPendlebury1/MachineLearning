# MachineLearning
_this project was for my disertation at Salford_

**This project was to demonsrate that machine learning and automation could work together for a simple use case of a webscraper proving the preformance and automation**

_for this project i used_
* selenuim _for webscraping_
* flask _as a web framework for python_
* and other packages to zip the files downloaded

### this is a much older project the reason why there arnt any commmits was because i didnt know the usefulness of git and remote repos
**this project is something i want to work more on, moving it forward to a real working product**

_the idea behind this was to automate a boring task, in my second year of uni at salford we needed to download a lot of pictures of campsites for a project there are a few websites that you can do this through but all of them needed manual review and I never got the results i expected_

# disclaimer
**this is is just a representation of the research i did for my dissertation**
